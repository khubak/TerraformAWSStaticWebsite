# TerraformAWSStaticWebsite
Terraform code for hosting a simple static website on Amazon Web Services.

AWS Static Website (S3 bucket) link: http://tnbucket1337.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html

TODO: Documentation, recheck Terraform S3 bucket reading/writing AWS permissions (some were made "by-hand" through AWS website during testing), add redirection.
